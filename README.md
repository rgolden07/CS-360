Portfolio Submission

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The users need for this app was the ability to implament a shell database that held the users that register in the app, as well as managing an inventory.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The login screen was a must since it was the gateway in to the program as well as the registration of the user if they hadnt already registered.  No they werent successful.... i failed miserably.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

My approach was one class and screen at a time, but you see how well that went for me.  I feel it could be a decent strategy, but if it fails again i will readdress the situation at that time. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

Booted up the emulator and simulated the end user.  Yes this process was important because it let me know when a piece of my code wasnt working correctly and was in need of fixing.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The very end trying to get the finished product out of the door.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I dont particularly know... it kind of felt like a dumpster fire the entire time, and I did great on all the other assignments, but this one straight up destroied me.
